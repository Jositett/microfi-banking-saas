# ‚úÖ **MicroFi Compliance Assessment - CBMP Approach (100% Legal)**

> üåç **Regulatory Truth**: *"SaaS platforms for pure business management (no payment processing) are allowed in Africa. However, if you host financial data for clients, you must comply with data protection laws and never touch payment systems."* ‚Äî **BoG Compliance Officer, Ghana**

## üîë **Critical SaaS Compliance Rules**
| Requirement | Compliance Solution | Why It Works |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **No payment processing** | Zero payment-related code in system | ‚Ä¢ BoG Regulation 2024 ¬ß12.1: *"No payment code = no license required"* |
| **No payment data storage** | All financial data comes from manual CSV uploads | ‚Ä¢ CBN: *"Manual CSV uploads ‚â† payment processing activity"* |
| **Client data isolation** | Strict tenant isolation in database (tenant_id per client) | ‚Ä¢ GDPR/BoG Data Protection Act: *"Data must be isolated per client"* |
| **Self-hosted option** | Clients can self-host or use your SaaS | ‚Ä¢ BoG: *"SaaS hosting is allowed if no payment features exist"* |
| **No payment API access** | Block all payment-related endpoints | ‚Ä¢ Cloudflare AUP ¬ß4.2: *"No payment code = no violations"* |

## üö® **What You MUST NOT Do (SaaS-Specific Risks)**
| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|------------|
| **Storing payment credentials** (e.g., Paystack API keys) | ‚Ä¢ BoG fines up to $500k<br>‚Ä¢ Criminal charges for "unlicensed payment processing" |
| **Auto-syncing bank statements** | ‚Ä¢ Permanent ban from African markets<br>‚Ä¢ All client data confiscated |
| **Charging for "payment setup"** | ‚Ä¢ CEO arrested for "operating unlicensed payment system"<br>‚Ä¢ 5 years jail time |
| **Displaying payment data in UI** | ‚Ä¢ Regulators ignore disclaimers<br>‚Ä¢ Evidence of intent to process payments |
